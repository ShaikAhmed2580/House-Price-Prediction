# House-Price-Prediction
In this project I used the boston house pricing dataset, I predicted the house prices using the linear regression algorithm after performing data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and got the model accuracy 68% which is better considering the dataset. I also used the Gradient Descent algorithm and got the much better accuarcy of 88% compared to previous algorithm.

Tools and Techniques:- Python, Machine Learning ( Linear Regression & Gradient Boosting Regressor)
